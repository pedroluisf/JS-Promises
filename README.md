# JS-Promisses

This project is a study on Javascript promises.

A javascript promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialize.

Some even say that Promises can be seen as the asynchronous version of "try-catch" blocks.

A promise has only three states, pending, resolved or rejected.

This project resulted from lessons obtained in order to perfect my coding capabilities in javascript promises both in ES6 and Angular Q.

Several scenarios were implemented, to try to handle issues like:

* Handling Promises as objects;
* Handling resolved or rejected promises;
* Chaining promises;
* Changing successes into failures (check weather API scenario);
* Assigning multiple "callbacks" to a single promise;
* Handling asynchronous mayhem (what order things come back);
* Controlling interdependent promises;
